# CS4423-001GameProject
Final Game Project for CS-4423-001

The game so far doesn't have much to it. Recently I had been struggling with another class which had led me to struggle and push back other classes/work for a time. I had recently dropped this class and had begun catching up on my work for this and other classes. The work that is here was over the course of a week, unfortunately I had forgotten to send it over to github until recently so that is why there isn't many commits. I will take the grade that I am given for this prototype with no excuses and would love feedback on how I can make this game fun and what I need to change.
